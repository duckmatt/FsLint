# FSharpLint

FSharpLint is a style checking tool for F#. It points out locations where a set of rules on how F# is to be styled have been broken.
The tool is configurable via XML and can be run from a console app, or as an MSBuild task. It also provides an interface to easily integrate the tool into other software.

The project aims to let the user know of problems through [matching user defined hints](http://fsprojects.github.io/FSharpLint/Hints.html) a la [HLint](http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/hlint/), and also by using custom rules written in F# similar to the rules in [Mascot](http://mascot.x9c.fr/manual.html) and [StyleCop](http://stylecop.codeplex.com/).

The tool in use (running as an MSBuild task with TreatWarningsAsErrors set to true):
