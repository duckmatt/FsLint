# MaxLinesInMember (FL0026)

## Cause

A member is made up of more than a configurable number of lines.

## Rationale

The larger a member becomes the more complex it becomes, it also indicates that it may have too many different responsibilities.

## How To Fix

Extract code out into private methods or functions.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "maxLinesInMember": {
            "enabled": false,
            "config": {
                "maxLines": 100
            }
        }
    }
