# MaxNumberOfItemsInTuple (FL0051)

## Cause

A tuple contains more than a configurable number of items, for example if `maxItems` was set to 4 (the default value)
then the following statement would cause the error: `let tup = (1, 2, 3, 5, 6)`

## Rationale

Tuple's items are not named, the more items there are the harder it is to work out what each is for.

## How To Fix

Reduce the number of items in the tuple, ideally replace the tuple with a record.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "maxNumberOfItemsInTuple": {
            "enabled": false,
            "config": {
                "maxItems": 4
            }
        }
    }
