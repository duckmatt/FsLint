# PatternMatchExpressionIndentation (FL0007)

## Cause

All pattern match expressions (to the right of -> after clause) should be at the same indentation level.

## Rationale

Readability.

## How To Fix

Update pattern match expressions to have consistent indentation.

## Rule Settings

Uses the `numIndentationSpaces` global setting.

    {
        "patternMatchExpressionIndentation": {
            "enabled": false
        }
    }
