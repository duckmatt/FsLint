# MaxLinesInFunction (FL0025)

## Cause

A function is made up of more than a configurable number of lines.

## Rationale

The larger a function becomes the more complex it becomes, it also indicates that it may have too many different responsibilities.

## How To Fix

Refactor to extract out code into smaller composable functions.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "maxLinesInFunction": {
            "enabled": false,
            "config": {
                "maxLines": 100
            }
        }
    }
