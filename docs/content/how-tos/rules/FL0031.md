# MaxLinesInEnum (FL0031)

## Cause

An enum is made up of more than a configurable number of lines.

## Rationale

The larger a enum becomes the more complex it becomes, it also indicates that all the items may not be related.

## How To Fix

Extract code out into smaller enums.

## Rule Settings

    {
        "maxLinesInEnum": {
            "enabled": false,
            "config": {
                "maxLines": 500
            }
        }
    }
