# FunctionReimplementation

Set of rules that highlight lambda functions that can removed through eta reduction.

### Analyser Settings

`enabled` - A boolean property that can enable and disable this analyser. (Default true)

### Rules

#### ReimplementsFunction

##### Cause

A lambda function does nothing other than call an existing function, two examples below:

`fun x y -> x + y`
`fun x y -> foo x y`

##### Rationale

The lambda functions are redundant.

##### How To Fix

Replace the lambda with the function that is being called.

`fun x y -> x + y` is the same as `(+)`
`fun x y -> foo x y` is the same as `foo`

##### Rule Settings

`enabled` - A boolean property that can enable and disable this rule. (Default true)

#### CanBeReplacedWithComposition

##### Cause

A lambda function applies a single argument to a chain of function calls, two examples below:

`fun x -> not(isValid(x))`
`fun x -> x |> isValid |> not`

##### Rationale

The lambda functions are redundant.

##### How To Fix

Replace the lambda with function composition:

`fun x -> not(isValid(x))` and `fun x -> x |> isValid |> not` are the same as `isValid >> not`

##### Rule Settings

`enabled` - A boolean property that can enable and disable this rule. (Default true)
