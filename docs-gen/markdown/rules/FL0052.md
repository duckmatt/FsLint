# MaxNumberOfFunctionParameters (FL0052)

## Cause

A function contains more than a configurable number of parameters, for example if `maxItems` was set to 5 (the default value)
then the following condition would cause the error: `let findCat one two three four five six = 0`

## Rationale

Too many parameters make the function difficult to use.

## How To Fix

Reduce the number of function parameters, e.g. to fix the example in the "Cause": `let findCat one two three four five = 0`. A good way to reduce the number of parameters is to group them using records.

## Rule Settings

	[lang=javascript]
    {
        "maxNumberOfFunctionParameters": { 
            "enabled": true,
            "maxItems": 5
        }
    }
