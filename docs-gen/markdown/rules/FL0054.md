# MaxNumberOfBooleanOperatorsInCondition (FL0054)

## Cause

A `while/if/assert/match when` condition contains more than a configurable number of boolean operators, for example if `maxItems` was set to 4 (the default value)
then the following condition would cause the error: `if x && y || q || r && t && w then`

## Rationale

Can make the control flow become diffcult to understand.

## How To Fix

Reduce the number of boolean operators in the `while/if/assert/match when` condition, e.g. a simple way to fix the example in the "Cause" section you could name the expression:

    let catIsInBin = x && y || q || r && t && w
    if catIsInBin then

## Rule Settings

	[lang=javascript]
    {
        "maxNumberOfBooleanOperatorsInCondition": { 
            "enabled": true,
            "maxItems": 4
        }
    }
