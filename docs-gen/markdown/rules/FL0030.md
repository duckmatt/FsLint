# MaxLinesInRecord (FL0030)

## Cause

A record is made up of more than a configurable number of lines.

## Rationale

The larger a record becomes the more complex it becomes, it also indicates that all the items may not be related.

## How To Fix

Extract code out into smaller composed records.

## Rule Settings

	[lang=javascript]
    {
        "maxLinesInRecord": { 
           "enabled": true,
            maxLines: 500
        }
    }
