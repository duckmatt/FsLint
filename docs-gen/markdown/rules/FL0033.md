# MaxLinesInClass (FL0033)

## Cause

A class is made up of more than a configurable number of lines.

## Rationale

The larger a class becomes the more complex it becomes, it also indicates that it may have [too many different responsibilities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle).

## How To Fix

Extract code out into smaller composable classes.

## Rule Settings

	[lang=javascript]
    {
        "maxLinesInClass": { 
           "enabled": true,
            maxLines: 500
        }
    }
