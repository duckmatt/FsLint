# MaxLinesInMatchLambdaFunction (FL0023)

## Cause

A match function is made up of more than a configurable number of lines.

## Rationale

The larger a function becomes the more complex it becomes, it also indicates that it may have too many different responsibilities.

## How To Fix

Use active patterns to help reduce the number of matches/extract code out into composable functions.

## Rule Settings

	[lang=javascript]
    {
        "maxLinesInMatchLambdaFunction": { 
           "enabled": true,
            maxLines: 70
        }
    }
