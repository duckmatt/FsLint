# MaxLinesInLambdaFunction (FL0022)

## Cause

A lambda function is made up of more than a configurable number of lines.

## Rationale

Lambda functions are usually used for single lines of code that aren't worth naming to make code more concise. A large lambda function indicates it should probably be a named function.

## How To Fix

Consider using a named function rather than a lambda function.

## Rule Settings

	[lang=javascript]
    {
        "maxLinesInLambdaFunction": { 
            "enabled": true,
            maxLines: 7
        }
    }
