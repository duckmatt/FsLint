# ReimplementsFunction (FL0034)

## Cause

A lambda function does nothing other than call an existing function, two examples below:

`fun x y -> x + y`
`fun x y -> foo x y`

## Rationale

The lambda functions are redundant.

## How To Fix

Replace the lambda with the function that is being called.

`fun x y -> x + y` is the same as `(+)`
`fun x y -> foo x y` is the same as `foo`

## Rule Settings

    {
        "reimplementsFunction": { 
            "enabled": true
        }
    }
