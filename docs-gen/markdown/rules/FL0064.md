# NoTabCharacters (FL0064)

## Cause

A tab character was found in a file.

## Rationale

It's best practice to use spaces to indent code rather than tabs, this is because tabs have different widths on different platforms.

## How To Fix

Replace the tab with spaces.

## Rule Settings

	[lang=javascript]
    {
        "noTabCharacters": { 
            "enabled": true
        }
    }
