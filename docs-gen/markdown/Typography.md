# Typography

Set of rules that analyse the text in a file.

### Rules

#### MaxLinesInFile

##### Cause

More than a configurable number of lines were found in a file.

##### Rationale

Too many lines in a file indicate it's becoming too complex.

##### How To Fix

Refactor to extract code out into another file.

##### Rule Settings

`enabled` - A boolean property that can enable and disable this rule. (Default true)

`maxLinesInFile` - An integer property that specifies the maximum number of lines allowed in a file. (Default 1000)

#### MaxCharactersOnLine

##### Cause

More than a configurable number of characters were on a single line.

##### Rationale

Too many characters on a single line make code harder to read by forcing the reader to scroll horizontally.

##### How To Fix

Break the line up into multiple lines.

##### Rule Settings

`enabled` - A boolean property that can enable and disable this rule. (Default false)

`maxCharactersOnLine` - An integer property that specifies the maximum number of characters allowed on a line. (Default 120)

#### NoTabCharacters

##### Cause

A tab character was found in a file.

##### Rationale

It's best practice to use spaces to indent code rather than tabs, this is because tabs have different widths on different platforms.

##### How To Fix

Replace the tab with spaces.

##### Rule Settings

`enabled` - A boolean property that can enable and disable this rule. (Default true)

#### TrailingNewLineInFile

##### Cause

A new line was found at the end of a file.

##### Rationale

Pointless whitespace.

##### How To Fix

Remove any new lines at the end of a file.

##### Rule Settings

`enabled` - A boolean property that can enable and disable this rule. (Default true)

#### TrailingWhitespaceOnLine

##### Cause

Whitespace was found at the end of a line.

##### Rationale

Pointless whitespace.

##### How To Fix

Remove any whitespace from the end of the line.

##### Rule Settings

`enabled` - A boolean property that can enable and disable this rule. (Default true)

`numberOfSpacesAllowed` - An integer property that specifies how many space characters are allowed on the end of a line. (Default 1)

`oneSpaceAllowedAfterOperator` - A boolean property that will allow a single space on the end of the line if it's preceded by an operator/symbol character. (Default true)

`ignoreBlankLines` - A boolean property that will ignore any lines that are made up of just whitespace. (Default true)
